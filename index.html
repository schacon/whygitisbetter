							Probably Git's most compelling feature that really makes it stand
							apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching
							model.  It is completely different from all of the models I'm 
							comparing it to here, most of which recommend that the best branch
							is basically a clone of the repository in a new directory.
						</div>
						
						<div class="text">
							Git does not work like that.  Git will allow you to have multiple
							local branches that can be entirely independent of each other and
							the creation, merging and deletion of those lines of development
							take seconds.
						</div>
						
						
						<div class="text">
							This means that you can do things like:
							<ul>
								<li>Create a branch to try out an idea, commit
									a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, 
									switch back to where you are experimenting, then merge it in.
								</li>
								<li>Have a branch that always contains only what goes to production,
									another that you merge work into for testing and several smaller
									ones for day to day work
								</li>
								<li>Create new branches for each new feature you're working on, so
									you can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete
									each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line.
								</li>
								<li>Create a branch to experiment in, realize it's not going to
									work and just delete it, abandoning the work&mdash;with nobody else
									ever seeing it (even if you've pushed other branches in the meantime)
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						
						<img src="images/branches.png" alt="branches flowchart"/>
						
						<div class="text">
							Importantly, when you push to a remote repository, you do <em>not</em>
							have to push all of your branches.  You can only share one of your
							branches and not all of them.  This tends to free people to try
							new ideas without worrying about having to plan how and when they
							are going to merge it in or share it with others.
						</div>
						
						<div class="text">
							You <em>can</em> find ways to do some of this with other systems, but the work
							involved is much more difficult and error-prone.  Git makes this
							process incredibly easy and it changes the way most developers
							work when they learn it.

							This is basically true of all the distributed SCMs, but in my
							experience even more so with Git.  There is very little outside
							of 'fetch', 'pull' and 'push' that communicates in any way with 
							anything other than your hard disk.
						</div>

						<div class="text">
							This not only makes most operations much faster than you may
              be used to, but it also allows you to work on stuff offline.
              That may not sound like a big deal, but I'm always amazed at
              how often I actually do work offline.  Being able to branch,
              merge, commit and browse history of your project while on 
              the plane or train is very productive.

							before going offline and do comparisons, merges and logs of data
							that is on the server but not in your local branches yet.
						</div>
												
						<div class="text">
							This means that it's very easy to have copies of not only your

							Git is fast.  Everyone&mdash;even most of the hard core users of these
							other systems&mdash;generally give Git this title.  With Git, all
							operations are performed locally giving it a bit of a leg up on
							SVN and Perforce, both of which require network access for certain operations.
							However, even compared to the other DSCMs that also perform operations
							locally, Git is pretty fast. 
						</div>
					
						<div class="text">
							Part of this is likely because it was built to work on the Linux 
							kernel, which means that it has had to deal effectively with large
							repositories from day one.  Additionally, Git is written in C, reducing the
							overhead of runtimes associated with higher-level languages.
							Another reason that Git is so fast is that the primary developers
							have made this a design goal of the application.
						</div>

						<div class="text">
							The following are a number of benchmarks that I performed on three
							copies of the Django source code repository in 3 different SCMs:
							Git, Mercurial and Bazaar.  I also tested some of this stuff in SVN,
							but trust me, it's slower&mdash;basically take the Bazaar numbers and
							then add network latency...

					<div class="contents">
						<div class="text">
							Unlike the other systems, Git has what it calls the "staging area"
							or "index".  This is an intermediate area that you can setup what
							you want your commit to look like before you commit it.
						</div>
						<div class="text">
							The cool thing about the staging area, and what sets Git apart 
							from all these other tools, is that you can easily stage some of
							your files as you finish them and then commit them without committing
							all the modified files in your working directory, or having to list
							them on the command line during the commit
						</div>
						<div class="center"><img src="images/index1.png" alt="add commit workflow diagram" /></div>
						
						<div class="text">
						  This also allows you to stage only portions of a modified file.  Gone are
						  the days of making two logically unrelated modifications to a file before
						  you realized that you forgot to commit one them.  Now you can just stage
						  the change you need for the current commit and stage the other change for
						  the next commit.  This feature scales up to as many different changes to
						  your file as you need.
						</div>

						<div class="text">
							Of course, Git also makes it pretty easy to ignore this feature
							if you don't want that kind of control&mdash;just slap a '-a' to your

					  <div class="text">
              One of the coolest features of any of the Distributed SCMs, Git included, is that it's
              distributed.  This means that instead of doing a "checkout" of the current tip of 
              the source code, you do a "clone" of the entire repository.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              This means that even 
              if you're using a centralized workflow, every user has what is essentially a full
              backup of the main server, each of which could be pushed up to replace the main server
              in the event of a crash or corruption.  There is basically no single point of failure
              with Git unless there is only a single point.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
              This does not slow things down much, either.  On average, an SVN checkout is only marginally
              faster than any of the DSCMs. Of the DSCMs I tested, Git was the fastest.

						One of the amazing things about Git is that because of its distributed

					<h3>Subversion-Style Workflow</h3>
					

					<div class="text">
						A very common Git workflow, especially from people transitioning
						from a centralized system, is a centralized workflow.  Git will 
						not allow you to push if someone has pushed since the last time
						you fetched, so a centralized model where all developers push to
						the same server works just fine.

					<div class="center"><img src="images/workflow-a.png" alt="subversion-style workflow" /></div><br/>
					
					<h3>Integration Manager Workflow</h3>

					<div class="text">
						Another common Git workflow is where there is an integration 
						manager&mdash;a single person who commits to the 'blessed' repository,
						and then a number of developers who clone from that repository, 
						push to their own independent repositories and ask the integrator
						to pull in their changes.  This is the type of development model 
						you often see with open source or GitHub repositories.
					</div>

					<div class="center"><img src="images/workflow-b.png" alt="integration manager workflow" /></div><br/>

					<h3>Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow</h3>

					<div class="text">
						For more massive projects, you can setup your developers similar to

					<div class="text">					
						GitHub is a reason to use Git for many people because it is more 
						like a social network for code than a simple hosting site.  People
						find other developers or projects that are similar to the things
						they are doing, and can easily fork and contribute, creating a very
						vibrant community around Git and the projects that people use it
						for.
					</div>
					
					<div class="text">					
						There exist other services, both for Git and for the other SCMs,
						but few are user-oriented or socially
						targeted, and none have anywhere near the user-base.  
						This social aspect of GitHub is killer, and this in combination of the above features
						make working with Git and GitHub a great combination for rapidly 
						developing open source projects.

					<div class="text">					
            This type of community is simply not available with any of the other SCMs.

						This did not used to be true&mdash;early in Git's life, it was not really

					Prior to Git 1.6, all of the Git commands used to be in the executable
					path, which was very confusing to people.  Although Git still recognizes
					all of those commands, the only command in the path is now 'git'.
					So, if you look at Mercurial and Git, Git has a nearly identical 
					command set and help system&mdash;there is very little difference from 
					a beginning UI perspective today.
